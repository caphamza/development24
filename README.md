Clone the project - npm i - npx pod-install - react-native run-ios

The code will work only in IOS as Firestore settings are not integrated into android due to lack of time

What's focused
1. Functionality
2. UX (fetch data at once. so even if during the Quiz internet disconnects user can complete current Quiz)
3. Schema Design (Schema designed by keeping in mind the complete workflow. although workflow is not completed because of time)

What more can be done with time

1. UI can be improved a lot
2. Liner gradients can be added
3. icons can be added
4. Type checking of Firestore response
5. Error Handling
6. Unit Testing/edge cases
7. Additional screen at the end of the test to output the result

No UI library used in the project.
Screenshots are added in the Screenshot folder
